Hi! This is my first project I'm working on that isn't just for a class. It's in python since it'll be faster to implement.

I plan to give it basic functions to start such as listing, searching, adding, and deleting contacts. To begin with, it'll only be the name and number
but i will eventually try to add more info to the contacts

I might end up redoing this in C as well since it's my prefered language
